"You've written the authentication views for your application, but if "

"In your application, you will use templates to render `HTML`_ which will "
"display in the user's browser. In Flask, Jinja is configured to "
"*autoescape* any data that is rendered in HTML templates. This means that"
" it's safe to render user input; any characters they've entered that "
"could mess with the HTML, such as ``<`` and ``>`` will be *escaped* with "
"*safe* values that look the same in the browser but don't cause unwanted "
"effects."

"Jinja looks and behaves mostly like Python. Special delimiters are used "
"to distinguish Jinja syntax from the static data in the template. "
"Anything between ``{{`` and ``}}`` is an expression that will be output "
"to the final document. ``{%`` and ``%}`` denotes a control flow statement"
" like ``if`` and ``for``. Unlike Python, blocks are denoted by start and "
"end tags rather than indentation since static text within a block could "
"change indentation."
