"SQLite is convenient because it doesn't require setting up a separate "
"database server and is built-in to Python. However, if concurrent "
"requests try to write to the database at the same time, they will slow "
"down as each write happens sequentially. Small applications won't notice "
"this. Once you become big, you may want to switch to a different "
"database."
